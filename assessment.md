## Task 1: Dockerize a Python Application

1. **Create a Dockerfile:**  
   - Write a `Dockerfile` that sets up the environment for your Python application.
   - Include installation of dependencies and instructions to run your Python app.

2. **Build the Image:**  
   - Build your Docker image from the `Dockerfile`.
     
3. **Run the Container:**  
   - Run a container from your built image.

4. **Push the Image to Docker Hub:**

## Task 2 (Extra Credit): Run a Web Application from Docker Hub

1. **Pull an Image:**  
   - Choose an image for either Apache2 or Nginx from Docker Hub.

2. **Run the Web Application:**  
   - Run a container using the pulled image.
   - Map the appropriate port(s) to access the web server.

3. **Verify Operation:**  
   - Ensure that the web server (Apache2/Nginx) is up and running.
   - Provide evidence (logs or screenshots) that the container is functioning correctly.

- Provide the exact commands used to build, run, and push the Docker image.
- Include any evidence (screenshots/log outputs) showing that your containers are running properly.
- Optionally, add notes or comments that describe your process and any challenges you encountered.
